                  What is the difference between var, let and const in

                  var keyword in JavaScript: The var is the oldest keyword to
                  declare a variable in JavaScript. <br />
                  Scope: Global scoped or function scoped. The scope of the var
                  keyword is the global or function scope. It means variables
                  defined outside the function can be accessed globally, and
                  variables defined inside a particular function can be accessed
                  within the function. <br />
                  let keyword in JavaScript: The let keyword is an improved
                  version of the var keyword. <br />
                  Scope: block scoped: The scope of a let variable is only block
                  scoped. It can’t be accessible outside the particular block
                  ({block}). Let’s see the below example. <br />
                  const keyword in JavaScript: The const keyword has all the
                  properties that are the same as the let keyword, except the
                  user cannot update it. <br />
                  Scope: block scoped: When users declare a const variable, they
                  need to initialize it, otherwise, it returns an error. The
                  user cannot update the const variable once it is declared.

                  What is the difference between arrow function and regular
                  function?
                </h5>
                <p class="card-text">
                  The first and most obvious difference between arrow functions
                  and regular functions is their syntax. Not only do they look
                  different, but arrow functions also provide an implicit return
                  shorthand and allow parenthesis around a single argument to be
                  omitted.Due to arrow functions not defining their own
                  execution context, they're not well-suited for usage as
                  methods. However, thanks to the Class fields proposal, arrow
                  functions can be used as methods inside classes, if your
                  environment supports it.Regular functions can be used as
                  constructors, using the new keyword. Yet another consequence
                  of the lexical resolution of this inside arrow functions is
                  that they cannot be used as constructors. Using new with an
                  arrow function results in a TypeError.Another difference is
                  the binding of the arguments object. Unlike regular functions,
                  arrow functions don't have their own arguments object. A
                  modern alternative that circumvents this limitation is the
                  usage of rest parameters.

                  what is the difference between map, foreach, filter and find
                  in javascript?
                </h5>
                <p class="card-text">
                  Map:Map like filter & foreach takes a callback and run it
                  against every element on the array but whats makes it unique
                  is it generate a new array based on your existing array.Map
                  ran through every element of the array, multiplied it to 10
                  and returned the element which will be going to store inside
                  our resulting array. <br />
                  Foreach: Foreach takes a callback function and run that
                  callback function on each element of array one by
                  one.Basically forEach works as a traditional for loop looping
                  over the array and providing you array elements to do
                  operations on them. <br />
                  Filter:checks every element in an array to see if it meets a
                  certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements
                  that return truthy for the criteria. <br />
                  Find:find() method in Javascript is used to get the value of
                  the first element in the array that satisfies the provided
                  condition. It checks all the elements of the array and
                  whichever first element satisfies the condition is going to
                  print

                  Why do use template string in javascript?
                </h5>
                <p class="card-text">
                  Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript
                  released in ES6. It lets us insert/interpolate variables and
                  expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like
                  in older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create
                  strings that are complex and contain dynamic elements.

                  What is the difference between "slice", " split", and
                  "divide"?
                </h5>
                <p class="card-text">
                  Slice - Cut into thin strips. Can also mean to smoothly cut
                  with a knife or blade, whether making cuts in something, or
                  cutting completely through something. A graceful, fluid, thin
                  movement through something that separates that something can
                  be called a slice. Split - Separate into portions neatly. This
                  can refer to distributing many pieces of something, breaking
                  something into portions, or cutting something into portions.
                  There is no implication on the shape of the pieces, but
                  somewhat of a n implication that the pieces are the same size
                  unless you say otherwise. If you split something with a blade,
                  and it's not in half, it could be assumed to be a heavy blade
                  like an axe. Divide - Simply means to make or keep separated.
                  Things that are divided may not have been one unit and may not
                  need to be cut with anything. Can be used for things like
                  groups of people, etc. Can have an implication that you want
                  to keep things apart or separate and not have them mix for
                  some reason. You can slice, split, and divide things into more
                  than 2 pieces. Divide is the most abstract of the terms.
